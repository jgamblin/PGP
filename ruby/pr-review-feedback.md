### What to Look For

- SQL injection vulnerabilities (unsafe string interpolation)
- Mass assignment issues (missing strong parameters)
- Unsafe user input handling
- Missing authentication/authorization checks

**Performance Issues**
- N+1 database queries
- Missing database indexes
- Inefficient ActiveRecord queries
- Memory leaks or excessive object creation

**Code Quality Issues**
- Methods that are too long or complex
- Classes doing too much (single responsibility violations)
- Unclear variable or method names
- Missing error handling

**Rails Best Practices**
- Not following Rails conventions
- Improper use of ActiveRecord associations
- Missing validations on models
- Poor controller organization

**Testing Gaps**
- Missing tests for new functionality
- Tests that don't cover edge cases
- Brittle or unclear test descriptions

## Common Ruby Code Issues

### Security Problems
```ruby
# SQL injection vulnerability
def find_user(name)
 User.where("name = '#{name}'")
end

# Safe parameterized query
def find_user(name)
 User.where(name: name)
end
```

### Performance Issues
```ruby
# N+1 query problem
def show_posts
 @posts = Post.all
 @posts.each { |post| puts post.author.name }
end

# Eager loading
def show_posts
 @posts = Post.includes(:author)
 @posts.each { |post| puts post.author.name }
end
```

### Code Organization
```ruby
# Method doing too much
def process_order(order_data)
 # 50 lines of validation, processing, etc.
end

# Broken into smaller methods
def process_order(order_data)
 return unless valid_order?(order_data)

 order = create_order(order_data)
 send_confirmation_email(order)
 update_inventory(order)
end
```

## Review Tips

### Be Constructive
- Point out what's working well, not just problems
- Suggest specific improvements with code examples
- Explain why changes would help (security, performance, readability)

### Focus on Impact
- **High Priority**: Security issues, bugs, major performance problems
- **Medium Priority**: Code organization, minor performance improvements
- **Low Priority**: Style preferences, minor refactoring suggestions

### Ask Questions
- "Could this method be simplified?"
- "Are there any edge cases we should test?"
- "Would this handle large datasets efficiently?"

## Quick Review Checklist

### Before Approving
- [ ] No obvious security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Performance looks reasonable (no obvious N+1 queries)
- [ ] Code is readable and well-organized
- [ ] Important functionality has tests
- [ ] Error handling is appropriate
- [ ] Follows Ruby/Rails conventions

### Git Commands for PR Review
```bash
# See what branch you're on
git branch --show-current

# See what Ruby files changed
git diff main...HEAD --name-only | grep '\.rb$'

# See the actual changes
git diff main...HEAD

# See changes in specific file
git diff main...HEAD path/to/file.rb
```

## Example Review Comments

### Security Issue
```
 **Security Issue**: This code is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Current:**
```ruby
User.where("name = '#{params[:name]}'")
```

**Suggested:**
```ruby
User.where(name: params[:name])
```

This uses parameterized queries which safely escape user input.
```

### Performance Issue
```
 **Performance**: This will cause N+1 queries when displaying posts.

**Current:**
```ruby
@posts = Post.all
# In view: post.author.name causes extra query for each post
```

**Suggested:**
```ruby
@posts = Post.includes(:author)
```

This eager loads authors in a single query.
```

### Code Organization
```
 **Suggestion**: This method is doing quite a lot. Consider breaking it down.

**Could be split into:**
- `validate_order_data`
- `create_order`
- `send_notifications`

This would make it easier to test and understand each piece.
```

## Follow-Up & Continuous Improvement

### Feedback Loop
After implementing changes:

1. **Verify improvements**
   - Run all tests to ensure nothing broke
   - Check that metrics improved (quality scores, performance)
   - Gather feedback from team members or users
   - Validate that issues are actually resolved

2. **Monitor impact**
   - Track if bugs decreased in modified areas
   - Measure if development velocity improved
   - Note if system reliability increased
   - Observe user satisfaction changes

3. **Document learnings**
   - Update team standards based on findings
   - Create architecture decision records (ADRs) for significant changes
   - Share successful patterns and approaches
   - Update documentation with new practices

### When to Get Team Input
When to discuss with your teammates:
- **Breaking changes needed**: Discuss with the team before making major changes
- **Performance degradation**: Roll back and investigate if metrics worsen significantly
- **Test coverage drops**: Pause changes to add tests first
- **Security concerns**: Pair with a teammate on authentication, authorization, or data handling code
- **Team confusion**: Provide additional documentation, pairing, or training

### Continuous Improvement
- Schedule regular reviews (weekly/monthly/quarterly based on project activity)
- Gradually increase quality standards as codebase improves
- Celebrate wins and improvements with the team
- Keep improvements incremental and sustainable
- Build a culture of quality and continuous learning

### Process Optimization
Based on findings, consider updating:
- **Coding standards**: Add patterns that prevent common issues
- **Review checklists**: Include checks for identified problem areas
- **CI/CD pipelines**: Add automated checks for recurring issues
- **Documentation templates**: Standardize important documentation
- **Team practices**: Share knowledge and establish better workflows


## Remember

- **Be helpful, not harsh**: Focus on improving the code, not criticizing the developer
- **Provide examples**: Show what good code looks like
- **Explain the why**: Help others learn by explaining the reasoning
- **Prioritize issues**: Security and bugs first, style preferences last
- **Acknowledge good work**: Point out things that were done well

That's it! Keep your reviews focused on helping improve the code in practical ways for personal projects.
