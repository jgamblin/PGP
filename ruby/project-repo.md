```markdown
# My Ruby Project

Brief description of what your project does.

## Setup

1. Install Ruby 3.1.0
2. Run `bundle install` to install dependencies
3. Run `rspec` to run tests

## Usage

Explain how to use your project with examples.
```

### .gitignore (Files to Ignore)
```
*.gem
*.log
.bundle/
vendor/bundle/
.env
```

## Testing Setup (RSpec)

### spec/spec_helper.rb
```ruby
RSpec.configure do |config|
 config.expect_with :rspec do |expectations|
 expectations.include_chain_clauses_in_custom_matcher_descriptions = true
 end

 config.mock_with :rspec do |mocks|
 mocks.verify_partial_doubles = true
 end

 config.shared_context_metadata_behavior = :apply_to_host_groups
end
```

### Basic Test Example
```ruby
# spec/my_project_spec.rb
require 'spec_helper'
require_relative '../lib/my_project'

RSpec.describe MyProject do
 describe '#hello' do
 it 'returns a greeting' do
 expect(MyProject.hello).to eq('Hello, World!')
 end
 end
end
```

## Development Tools

### RuboCop (.rubocop.yml)
```yaml
AllCops:
 TargetRubyVersion: 3.1
 NewCops: enable

Style/Documentation:
 Enabled: false # Don't require class documentation for small projects

Metrics/MethodLength:
 Max: 15 # Keep methods reasonably short
```

## Getting Started Steps

1. **Create project directory**: `mkdir my-ruby-project && cd my-ruby-project`
2. **Initialize git**: `git init`
3. **Create Gemfile**: Add your dependencies
4. **Install gems**: `bundle install`
5. **Create basic structure**: lib/, spec/, README.md
6. **Write first test**: Create a simple spec file
7. **Write code**: Make the test pass
8. **Set up RuboCop**: Add .rubocop.yml for code style

## Quick Tips

### For Rails Projects
- Use `rails new my_app` to generate the basic structure
- Add `gem 'rspec-rails'` to Gemfile for testing
- Run `rails generate rspec:install` to set up RSpec

### For Simple Ruby Projects
- Keep it simple - don't over-engineer the structure
- Start with one main file in lib/
- Add tests as you add features
- Use bundler to manage dependencies

### For Gems
- Use `bundle gem my_gem` to generate gem structure
- Include a proper gemspec file
- Follow semantic versioning

## Common Project Types

**Web Application**: Use Rails or Sinatra
**API**: Rails API mode or Grape framework
**Command Line Tool**: Simple Ruby script with Thor gem
**Library/Gem**: Standard gem structure with lib/ and spec/
**Script**: Single Ruby file for automation tasks

Remember: Start simple and add complexity only when needed!




## Tooling & Automation

Recommended tools and commands for Ruby/Rails development:

### Analysis & Quality Tools
```bash
# Ruby code quality
bundle exec rubocop

# Testing
bundle exec rspec

# Security
bundle exec brakeman
bundle audit
```

### Git Analysis
```bash
# Review changes
git diff main...HEAD --stat
git log --oneline -10

# Identify changed files
git diff main...HEAD --name-only
```

### CI/CD Integration
Recommend adding these to your development workflow:
```bash
# Pre-commit hooks
pre-commit run rubocop --all-files
pre-commit run rspec --all-files
```

### Pre-commit Hooks (Recommended)
```bash
# Install pre-commit framework
pip install pre-commit  # or brew install pre-commit

# Set up hooks
pre-commit install
pre-commit run --all-files
```


## Metrics & Validation

Define clear success criteria for outcomes:

### Quality Guidelines
- **Security**: Zero critical vulnerabilities, zero hardcoded secrets
- **Code Quality**: RuboCop passes with minimal warnings
- **Complexity**: Cyclomatic complexity <10 per function/method
- **Duplication**: No code blocks duplicated more than twice
- **Documentation**: Public APIs and complex logic documented

### Testing Thresholds
- **Critical paths**: 80% test coverage
- **All tests pass**: No failing tests without corresponding code changes
- **Test quality**: Tests verify behavior, not implementation details
- **Edge cases**: Error conditions and boundary cases tested

### Performance Benchmarks (if applicable)
- **No regressions**: Performance metrics maintained or improved
- **Response times**: Within acceptable thresholds for user-facing operations
- **Resource usage**: Memory and CPU usage within reasonable bounds
- **Scalability**: System handles expected load

### Operational Readiness
- **Documentation**: README, API docs, and runbooks up-to-date
- **Monitoring**: Key metrics and errors are observable
- **Deployment**: Automated deployment process works reliably



## Follow-Up & Continuous Improvement

### Feedback Loop
After implementing changes:

1. **Verify improvements**
   - Run all tests to ensure nothing broke
   - Check that metrics improved (quality scores, performance)
   - Gather feedback from team members or users
   - Validate that issues are actually resolved

2. **Monitor impact**
   - Track if bugs decreased in modified areas
   - Measure if development velocity improved
   - Note if system reliability increased
   - Observe user satisfaction changes

3. **Document learnings**
   - Update team standards based on findings
   - Create architecture decision records (ADRs) for significant changes
   - Share successful patterns and approaches
   - Update documentation with new practices

### When to Get Team Input
When to discuss with your teammates:
- **Breaking changes needed**: Discuss with the team before making major changes
- **Performance degradation**: Roll back and investigate if metrics worsen significantly
- **Test coverage drops**: Pause changes to add tests first
- **Security concerns**: Pair with a teammate on authentication, authorization, or data handling code
- **Team confusion**: Provide additional documentation, pairing, or training

### Continuous Improvement
- Schedule regular reviews (weekly/monthly/quarterly based on project activity)
- Gradually increase quality standards as codebase improves
- Celebrate wins and improvements with the team
- Keep improvements incremental and sustainable
- Build a culture of quality and continuous learning

### Process Optimization
Based on findings, consider updating:
- **Coding standards**: Add patterns that prevent common issues
- **Review checklists**: Include checks for identified problem areas
- **CI/CD pipelines**: Add automated checks for recurring issues
- **Documentation templates**: Standardize important documentation
- **Team practices**: Share knowledge and establish better workflows
