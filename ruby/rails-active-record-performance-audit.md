## Common Performance Issues

### N+1 Query Problems
```ruby
# N+1 Query Problem
# This will execute 1 query for posts + N queries for each author
@posts = Post.all
@posts.each do |post|
 puts post.author.name # N+1 query!
end

# Fixed with includes
@posts = Post.includes(:author)
@posts.each do |post|
 puts post.author.name # No additional queries
end
```

### Missing Database Indexes
```ruby
# Slow query without index
User.where(email: 'user@example.com') # Table scan

# Add index in migration
class AddIndexToUsersEmail < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]
 def change
 add_index :users, :email
 end
end
```

### Inefficient Queries
```ruby
# Loading unnecessary data
User.all.map(&:name) # Loads all columns

# Select only needed columns
User.select(:name).map(&:name)

# Counting with all records
User.all.count # Loads all records into memory

# Database count
User.count # Database-level count
```

## Performance Optimization Techniques

### Eager Loading Strategies
```ruby
# Use includes for associations you'll access
Post.includes(:author, :comments)

# Use preload when you don't need joins
Post.preload(:tags)

# Use eager_load when you need joins in WHERE clauses
Post.eager_load(:author).where(authors: { active: true })

# Use joins for filtering without loading associations
Post.joins(:author).where(authors: { active: true })
```

### Database Indexes
```ruby
# Add indexes for foreign keys
add_index :posts, :user_id

# Add indexes for frequently queried columns
add_index :users, :email
add_index :posts, :published_at

# Composite indexes for multi-column queries
add_index :posts, [:user_id, :published_at]

# Unique indexes for uniqueness constraints
add_index :users, :email, unique: true
```

### Query Optimization
```ruby
# Use find_each for large datasets
User.find_each(batch_size: 1000) do |user|
 # Process user
end

# Use pluck for single columns
user_names = User.pluck(:name) # Returns array of names

# Use exists? instead of present?
if User.where(email: email).exists?
 # More efficient than .present?
end

# Use select for specific columns
User.select(:id, :name, :email)
```

### Caching Basics
```ruby
# Fragment caching in views
<% cache post do %>
 <%= render post %>
<% end %>

# Low-level caching
Rails.cache.fetch("user_#{user.id}_posts", expires_in: 1.hour) do
 user.posts.published.limit(10)
end

# Counter caching
class Post < ApplicationRecord
 belongs_to :user, counter_cache: true
end

# Add counter_cache column
add_column :users, :posts_count, :integer, default: 0
```

## Performance Analysis Tools

### Query Analysis
```ruby
# Enable query logging in development
# config/environments/development.rb
config.log_level = :debug

# Use explain to analyze queries
User.where(email: 'test@example.com').explain

# Benchmark queries
Benchmark.measure do
 User.includes(:posts).limit(100).to_a
end
```

### N+1 Detection
```ruby
# Add to Gemfile for development
group :development do
 gem 'bullet'
end

# Configure in development.rb
config.after_initialize do
 Bullet.enable = true
 Bullet.alert = true
 Bullet.bullet_logger = true
 Bullet.console = true
end
```

### Memory Profiling
```ruby
# Add to Gemfile
gem 'memory_profiler'

# Profile memory usage
report = MemoryProfiler.report do
 # Your code here
 User.includes(:posts).limit(1000).to_a
end

report.pretty_print
```

## Performance Monitoring

### Database Query Monitoring
```ruby
# Log slow queries in production
# config/database.yml
production:
 adapter: postgresql
 # Log queries slower than 1 second
 min_messages: warning
 log_min_duration_statement: 1000
```

### Application Performance
```ruby
# Use Rails built-in instrumentation
ActiveSupport::Notifications.subscribe "sql.active_record" do |name, start, finish, id, payload|
 duration = finish - start
 if duration > 0.1 # Log queries > 100ms
 Rails.logger.warn "Slow query: #{payload[:sql]} (#{duration.round(3)}s)"
 end
end
```

## Tooling & Automation

Recommended tools and commands for Ruby/Rails development:

### Analysis & Quality Tools
```bash
# Ruby code quality
bundle exec rubocop

# Testing
bundle exec rspec

# Security
bundle exec brakeman
bundle audit
```

### Git Analysis
```bash
# Review changes
git diff main...HEAD --stat
git log --oneline -10

# Identify changed files
git diff main...HEAD --name-only
```

### CI/CD Integration
Recommend adding these to your development workflow:
```bash
# Pre-commit hooks
pre-commit run rubocop --all-files
pre-commit run rspec --all-files
```

### Pre-commit Hooks (Recommended)
```bash
# Install pre-commit framework
pip install pre-commit  # or brew install pre-commit

# Set up hooks
pre-commit install
pre-commit run --all-files
```


## Metrics & Validation

Define clear success criteria for outcomes:

### Quality Guidelines
- **Security**: Zero critical vulnerabilities, zero hardcoded secrets
- **Code Quality**: RuboCop passes with minimal warnings
- **Complexity**: Cyclomatic complexity <10 per function/method
- **Duplication**: No code blocks duplicated more than twice
- **Documentation**: Public APIs and complex logic documented

### Testing Thresholds
- **Critical paths**: 80% test coverage
- **All tests pass**: No failing tests without corresponding code changes
- **Test quality**: Tests verify behavior, not implementation details
- **Edge cases**: Error conditions and boundary cases tested

### Performance Benchmarks (if applicable)
- **No regressions**: Performance metrics maintained or improved
- **Response times**: Within acceptable thresholds for user-facing operations
- **Resource usage**: Memory and CPU usage within reasonable bounds
- **Scalability**: System handles expected load

### Deployment Readiness
- **Documentation**: README, API docs, and runbooks up-to-date
- **Monitoring**: Key metrics and errors are observable
- **Deployment**: Automated deployment process works reliably



## Follow-Up & Continuous Improvement

### Feedback Loop
After implementing changes:

1. **Verify improvements**
   - Run all tests to ensure nothing broke
   - Check that metrics improved (quality scores, performance)
   - Gather feedback from team members or users
   - Validate that issues are actually resolved

2. **Monitor impact**
   - Track if bugs decreased in modified areas
   - Measure if development velocity improved
   - Note if system reliability increased
   - Observe user satisfaction changes

3. **Document learnings**
   - Update team standards based on findings
   - Create architecture decision records (ADRs) for significant changes
   - Share successful patterns and approaches
   - Update documentation with new practices

### When to Get Team Input
When to discuss with your teammates:
- **Breaking changes needed**: Discuss with the team before making major changes
- **Performance degradation**: Roll back and investigate if metrics worsen significantly
- **Test coverage drops**: Pause changes to add tests first
- **Security concerns**: Pair with a teammate on authentication, authorization, or data handling code
- **Team confusion**: Provide additional documentation, pairing, or training

### Continuous Improvement
- Schedule regular reviews (weekly/monthly/quarterly based on project activity)
- Gradually increase quality standards as codebase improves
- Celebrate wins and improvements with the team
- Keep improvements incremental and sustainable
- Build a culture of quality and continuous learning

### Process Optimization
Based on findings, consider updating:
- **Coding standards**: Add patterns that prevent common issues
- **Review checklists**: Include checks for identified problem areas
- **CI/CD pipelines**: Add automated checks for recurring issues
- **Documentation templates**: Standardize important documentation
- **Team practices**: Share knowledge and establish better workflows


## Remember

For personal projects, focus on:
- **N+1 queries**: These are the biggest performance killers
- **Database indexes**: Essential for query performance
- **Memory usage**: Don't load more data than you need
- **Caching**: Start with simple fragment caching
- **Monitoring**: Use development tools to catch issues early

Don't over-optimize - focus on the performance issues that actually impact your users' experience.
