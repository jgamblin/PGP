group :development do
 gem 'rubocop', require: false
 gem 'rubocop-rails', require: false # For Rails projects
 gem 'rubocop-rspec', require: false # For RSpec tests
 gem 'rubocop-performance', require: false # Performance cops
end
```

```bash
bundle install
```

### Basic Configuration
```yaml
# .rubocop.yml
AllCops:
 TargetRubyVersion: 3.2
 NewCops: enable
 Exclude:
 - 'vendor/**/*'
 - 'db/schema.rb'
 - 'bin/**/*'
 - 'config/boot.rb'
 - 'config/environment.rb'
 - 'config/initializers/devise.rb'

 Max: 15

# Allow longer class lengths
Metrics/ClassLength:
 Max: 150

# Be more lenient with block length
Metrics/BlockLength:
 Exclude:

 - 'config/routes.rb'
```

## Running RuboCop

### Basic Commands
```bash
# Check all files
bundle exec rubocop

# Check specific file
bundle exec rubocop app/models/user.rb

# Auto-fix safe issues
bundle exec rubocop -a

# Auto-fix all issues (be careful!)
bundle exec rubocop -A

# Generate TODO file for existing violations
bundle exec rubocop --auto-gen-config
```

## Common Ruby Style Fixes

### String Literals
```ruby
# Inconsistent quotes
name = "John"
message = 'Hello'

# Consistent single quotes (unless interpolation needed)
name = 'John'
message = 'Hello'
greeting = "Hello, #{name}!"
```

### Method Definitions
```ruby
# Unnecessary parentheses
def greet()
 puts 'Hello'
end

# Clean method definition
def greet
 puts 'Hello'
end

# Use parentheses with parameters
def greet(name)
 puts "Hello, #{name}!"
end
```

### Hash Syntax
```ruby
# Old hash syntax
user = { :name => 'John', :age => 30 }

# New hash syntax for symbol keys
user = { name: 'John', age: 30 }

# Use hashrocket for mixed key types
config = { 'host' => 'localhost', port: 3000 }
```

### Array and Hash Formatting
```ruby
# Inconsistent spacing
array = [1,2,3,4]
hash = {name:'John',age:30}

# Consistent spacing
array = [1, 2, 3, 4]
hash = { name: 'John', age: 30 }

# Multi-line formatting for readability
long_array = [
 'first_item',
 'second_item',
 'third_item'
]
```

### Conditional Statements
```ruby
# Unnecessary condition complexity
if user.present? == true
 do_something
end

# Simple, clear conditions
if user.present?
 do_something
end

# Use guard clauses
def process_user(user)
 return unless user.present?

 # Main logic here
end
```

## Ruby Best Practices

### Use Meaningful Variable Names
```ruby
# Unclear names
u = User.find(1)
d = Date.current

# Clear, descriptive names
current_user = User.find(1)
today = Date.current
```

### Prefer Ruby Idioms
```ruby
# Verbose iteration
result = []
users.each do |user|
 result << user.name
end

# Use map for transformation
result = users.map(&:name)

# Manual nil checking
if user && user.name
 puts user.name
end

# Use safe navigation
puts user&.name
```

### Method Organization
```ruby
class User
 # Public methods first
 def full_name
 "#{first_name} #{last_name}"
 end

 def active?
 status == 'active'
 end

 private

 # Private methods at the bottom
 def normalize_name
 first_name.strip.titleize
 end
end
```

## Performance Tips

### String Concatenation
```ruby
# Slow for many concatenations
result = ''
items.each do |item|
 result += item.to_s
end

# Use array join for better performance
result = items.map(&:to_s).join
```

### Use Symbols for Keys
```ruby
# Strings as hash keys (slower)
config = { 'database' => 'postgres', 'host' => 'localhost' }

# Symbols as hash keys (faster)
config = { database: 'postgres', host: 'localhost' }
```

### Avoid Creating Unnecessary Objects
```ruby
# Creates new regex each time
def valid_email?(email)
 email.match(/\A[\w+\-.]+@[a-z\d\-]+(\.[a-z\d\-]+)*\.[a-z]+\z/i)
end

# Use constant regex
EMAIL_REGEX = /\A[\w+\-.]+@[a-z\d\-]+(\.[a-z\d\-]+)*\.[a-z]+\z/i

def valid_email?(email)
 email.match(EMAIL_REGEX)
end
```

## Rails-Specific Style

### Strong Parameters
```ruby
# Organize parameters clearly
private

def user_params
 params.require(:user).permit(
 :first_name,
 :last_name,
 :email,
 :phone
 )
end
```

### ActiveRecord Queries
```ruby
# String conditions (SQL injection risk)
User.where("name = '#{name}'")

# Use parameter binding
User.where(name: name)

# Use scopes for complex queries
class User < ApplicationRecord
 scope :active, -> { where(status: 'active') }
 scope :recent, -> { where('created_at > ?', 1.week.ago) }
end
```

## Tooling & Automation

Recommended tools and commands for Ruby/Rails development:

### Analysis & Quality Tools
```bash
# Ruby code quality
bundle exec rubocop

# Testing
bundle exec rspec

# Security
bundle exec brakeman
bundle audit
```

### Git Analysis
```bash
# Review changes
git diff main...HEAD --stat
git log --oneline -10

# Identify changed files
git diff main...HEAD --name-only
```

### CI/CD Integration
Recommend adding these to your development workflow:
```bash
# Pre-commit hooks
pre-commit run rubocop --all-files
pre-commit run rspec --all-files
```

### Pre-commit Hooks (Recommended)
```bash
# Install pre-commit framework
pip install pre-commit  # or brew install pre-commit

# Set up hooks
pre-commit install
pre-commit run --all-files
```


## Metrics & Validation

Define clear success criteria for outcomes:

### Quality Guidelines
- **Security**: Zero critical vulnerabilities, zero hardcoded secrets
- **Code Quality**: RuboCop passes with minimal warnings
- **Complexity**: Cyclomatic complexity <10 per function/method
- **Duplication**: No code blocks duplicated more than twice
- **Documentation**: Public APIs and complex logic documented

### Testing Thresholds
- **Critical paths**: 80% test coverage
- **All tests pass**: No failing tests without corresponding code changes
- **Test quality**: Tests verify behavior, not implementation details
- **Edge cases**: Error conditions and boundary cases tested

### Performance Benchmarks (if applicable)
- **No regressions**: Performance metrics maintained or improved
- **Response times**: Within acceptable thresholds for user-facing operations
- **Resource usage**: Memory and CPU usage within reasonable bounds
- **Scalability**: System handles expected load

### Deployment Readiness
- **Documentation**: README, API docs, and runbooks up-to-date
- **Monitoring**: Key metrics and errors are observable
- **Deployment**: Automated deployment process works reliably



## Follow-Up & Continuous Improvement

### Feedback Loop
After implementing changes:

1. **Verify improvements**
   - Run all tests to ensure nothing broke
   - Check that metrics improved (quality scores, performance)
   - Gather feedback from team members or users
   - Validate that issues are actually resolved

2. **Monitor impact**
   - Track if bugs decreased in modified areas
   - Measure if development velocity improved
   - Note if system reliability increased
   - Observe user satisfaction changes

3. **Document learnings**
   - Update team standards based on findings
   - Create architecture decision records (ADRs) for significant changes
   - Share successful patterns and approaches
   - Update documentation with new practices

### When to Get Team Input
When to discuss with your teammates:
- **Breaking changes needed**: Discuss with the team before making major changes
- **Performance degradation**: Roll back and investigate if metrics worsen significantly
- **Test coverage drops**: Pause changes to add tests first
- **Security concerns**: Pair with a teammate on authentication, authorization, or data handling code
- **Team confusion**: Provide additional documentation, pairing, or training

### Continuous Improvement
- Schedule regular reviews (weekly/monthly/quarterly based on project activity)
- Gradually increase quality standards as codebase improves
- Celebrate wins and improvements with the team
- Keep improvements incremental and sustainable
- Build a culture of quality and continuous learning

### Process Optimization
Based on findings, consider updating:
- **Coding standards**: Add patterns that prevent common issues
- **Review checklists**: Include checks for identified problem areas
- **CI/CD pipelines**: Add automated checks for recurring issues
- **Documentation templates**: Standardize important documentation
- **Team practices**: Share knowledge and establish better workflows


## Remember

For personal projects, focus on:
- **Consistency**: Keep your code style consistent
- **Readability**: Make code easy to understand
- **Ruby idioms**: Use Ruby's expressive features
- **Performance**: Apply basic performance improvements
- **Maintainability**: Write code that's easy to change later

Don't obsess over every RuboCop violation - focus on the ones that actually improve your code quality and maintainability.
