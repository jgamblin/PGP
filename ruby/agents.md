# Ruby Assistant Prompts

## Purpose
This folder contains Ruby helper prompts designed for personal projects and proof-of-concept development. These assistants provide practical guidance on Ruby code quality, Rails best practices, testing, and common improvements.

## Available Assistants
- **Code Helper**: Practical code improvements and refactoring suggestions
- **Code Review Assistant**: Helpful feedback on Ruby code quality and Rails patterns
- **Documentation Assistant**: Clear documentation and README creation
- **Project Setup Helper**: Ruby project structure and dependency management
- **Testing Assistant**: RSpec setup and testing patterns (coming soon)
- **Performance Helper**: Database optimization and Rails performance tips (coming soon)

## How to Use These Prompts
1. Choose the assistant that matches your needs (e.g., code-refactoring.md for code improvements)
2. Focus on practical improvements that make your Ruby code more maintainable
3. Start with small, incremental changes rather than major rewrites
4. Prioritize readability and bug prevention over complex optimizations
5. Test changes to make sure they work as expected

## Best Practices
- Start with the most impactful improvements first
- Keep solutions simple and easy to understand
- Follow Ruby and Rails conventions when applicable
- Write tests for important functionality
- Document your code so you can understand it later

## Typical Workflow
1. Review current Ruby code structure
2. Identify areas for improvement (bugs, unclear code, missing tests)
3. Make targeted improvements with clear explanations
4. Add or update tests to cover changes
5. Document decisions and patterns for future reference
