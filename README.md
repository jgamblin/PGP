## üß≠ Usage

### Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Pick a domain prompt (e.g. python/code-refactoring.md)
# 2. Copy prompt + relevant code into AI assistant
# 3. Save generated report: name like python-refactor-YYYY-MM-DD.md
# 4. Skim top issues ‚Üí pick 1‚Äì2 highest impact
# 5. Implement & validate (tests / lint / run)
# 6. Re-run prompt for delta analysis
```

### Tools Tested

Windsurf, Claude, GitHub Copilot, Cursor (others should work).

## üìä Report Output (What To Expect)

Each prompt produces a dated markdown file with:

- Dashboard / summary (security, performance, maintainability highlights)
- Issue list grouped by severity / category
- Concrete remediation suggestions (code snippets where relevant)
- Optional follow-up question offering next-step focus

Benefits: historical trace, shareable review artifact, incremental improvement tracking.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Approach & Cycle

Design principles: evidence-based analysis, smallest safe change, repeat.

Loop:

1. Analyze
2. Prioritize
3. Implement
4. Test / Verify
5. Re-run (compare deltas)

---

## üéñÔ∏è Quality Focus Areas

- Security (common vulnerability classes, unsafe patterns)
- Performance (hot paths, unnecessary allocations, query inefficiencies)
- Architecture (boundaries, cohesion, coupling)
- Testing (coverage of risk & regression vectors)
- Documentation (clarity of intent & public contracts)

---

## üìà Why It Helps (In Practice)

Common effects: earlier issue detection, clearer priorities, reduced rework, incremental hardening of performance & security posture.

Disclaimer: Effectiveness varies by codebase maturity and follow-through.

---

## üîÄ Fork & Adapt (No Direct PRs)

I am not accepting pull requests. If you want to extend or alter these:

1. Fork the repository
2. Adjust wording / sections to match your team or tooling
3. Rename or reorganize prompts as needed
4. Remove sections you don't use to reduce noise
5. Maintain attribution if large portions are reused

Feel free to publish your own variant.

## üîç Quick Start (TL;DR)

1. Pick prompt
2. Provide code
3. Save report
4. Triage top items
5. Implement + verify
6. Re-run for changes

---

## ‚úÖ Style Consistency (Optional)

- Sentence case headings
- Prefer "Analysis" / "Review" / "Report" labels
- Use "domain logic" not "business logic"
- Flat improvement task lists (no speculative effort estimates)
- Avoid unverifiable quantitative claims

See `LICENSE` for terms. Prompts may be reused with attribution to the original repository.
