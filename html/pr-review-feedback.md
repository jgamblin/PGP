## Common Issues to Catch

### Accessibility
```html
<!-- ❌ Missing alt -->
<img src="hero.jpg">

<!-- ✅ Fixed -->
<img src="hero.jpg" alt="Product showcase">

<!-- ❌ Missing label -->
<input type="email" placeholder="Email">

<!-- ✅ Fixed -->
<label for="email">Email</label>
<input type="email" id="email">
```

### Semantic HTML
```html
<!-- ❌ Div soup -->
<div class="header">
  <div class="nav">...</div>
</div>

<!-- ✅ Semantic -->
<header>
  <nav>...</nav>
</header>
```

### CSS Organization
```css
/* ❌ Bad specificity */
div.container > ul.nav > li.active > a {}

/* ✅ BEM class */
.nav__link--active {}

/* ❌ Magic numbers */
.card { margin: 13px 27px; }

/* ✅ Variables */
.card { margin: var(--spacing-sm) var(--spacing-lg); }
```

### Performance
```html
<!-- ❌ Missing dimensions -->
<img src="photo.jpg">

<!-- ✅ With dimensions -->
<img src="photo.jpg" width="800" height="600" loading="lazy">
```

## Feedback Format

### GitHub Suggestion Block
````markdown
**🟠 High: Missing form label**

This input needs a label for accessibility:

```suggestion
<label for="search">Search</label>
<input type="search" id="search" placeholder="Search...">
```

This helps screen reader users understand the input purpose.
````

### Inline Comment Format
```markdown
**🔴 Critical: Missing alt text**

File: `src/components/hero.html`, line 15

Images must have alt text for accessibility (WCAG 1.1.1).

Suggested fix:
- Add descriptive alt: `alt="Team collaborating in modern office"`
- Or mark as decorative: `alt=""`
```

## Review Tips

1. **Check accessibility first**: It's easy to miss and hard to fix later
2. **Test on mobile**: Many issues only appear on small screens
3. **Look at the design**: Does the code match intent?
4. **Consider performance**: Large images, blocking resources?
5. **Be constructive**: Suggest fixes, not just problems
6. **Acknowledge good work**: Positive feedback matters
