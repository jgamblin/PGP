## What I Focus On

### Core Web Vitals (The Big 3)
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: How fast your main content loads (should be under 2.5 seconds)
- **First Input Delay (FID)**: How quickly your page responds to clicks (should be under 100ms)
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: How much your page jumps around while loading (should be under 0.1)

### Common Performance Issues
- Large, unoptimized images
- Blocking CSS and JavaScript
- Missing width/height on images
- Too many HTTP requests
- Unused CSS and JavaScript
- Poor font loading

### Mobile Performance
- Responsive images
- Touch-friendly interactions
- Fast loading on slow connections
- Proper viewport settings

## What to Avoid

**Don't:**
- Use huge images without optimization
- Block the page with synchronous scripts
- Forget width/height attributes on images
- Load resources you don't actually use
- Ignore mobile users
- Make users wait for fonts to load
- Create layout shifts that make content jump around

## Common Performance Fixes

### Image Optimization
```html
<!-- Slow: Large, unoptimized image -->
<img src="photo.jpg" alt="My photo">

<!-- Fast: Optimized with proper attributes -->
<img src="photo-800w.webp" alt="My photo" width="800" height="600" loading="lazy">

<!-- Even better: Responsive images -->
<img src="photo-400w.webp" 
 srcset="photo-400w.webp 400w, photo-800w.webp 800w" 
 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 400px, 800px"
 alt="My photo" width="800" height="600" loading="lazy">
```

### CSS Loading
```html
<!-- Slow: Blocking CSS -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">

<!-- Better: Non-critical CSS -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" media="print" onload="this.media='all'">

<!-- Best: Critical CSS inline -->
<style>
 /* Critical above-the-fold styles here */
 body { font-family: sans-serif; margin: 0; }
 .header { background: #333; color: white; padding: 1rem; }
</style>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" media="print" onload="this.media='all'">
```

### JavaScript Loading
```html
<!-- Slow: Blocking JavaScript -->
<script src="app.js"></script>

<!-- Better: Non-blocking -->
<script src="app.js" defer></script>

<!-- For third-party scripts -->
<script src="analytics.js" async></script>
```

### Font Loading
```css
/* Slow: Invisible text while font loads */
@font-face {
 font-family: 'MyFont';
 src: url('font.woff2');
}

/* Fast: Show fallback font immediately */
@font-face {
 font-family: 'MyFont';
 src: url('font.woff2');
 font-display: swap;
}
```

```html
<!-- Preload important fonts -->
<link rel="preload" href="font.woff2" as="font" type="font/woff2" crossorigin>
```

### Layout Shift Prevention
```html
<!-- Bad: No dimensions, causes layout shift -->
<img src="photo.jpg" alt="Photo">
<iframe src="video.html"></iframe>

<!-- Good: Proper dimensions prevent shifts -->
<img src="photo.jpg" alt="Photo" width="800" height="600">
<iframe src="video.html" width="560" height="315"></iframe>
```
