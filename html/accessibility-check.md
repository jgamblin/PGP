## Accessibility Check Report

Provide a **practical accessibility review** for the website or component:

# Accessibility Check Results

## Quick Assessment
- **Overall Status**: [Good/Needs Work/Poor]
- **Key Issues Found**: [Number of major issues]
- **Priority Fixes**: [Most important items to address]

## Issues Found

### Issue 1: Missing Alt Text
- **Location**: `filename.html:line XX`
- **Problem**: Images without alt text can't be understood by screen readers
- **Impact**: Users with visual impairments miss important content
- **Fix**:
 ```html
 <!-- Before (Problem) -->
 <img src="hero-image.jpg" />

 <!-- After (Fixed) -->
 <img src="hero-image.jpg" 
 alt="Team collaborating on a project in a modern office" />

 <!-- For decorative images -->
 <img src="decoration.jpg" alt="" role="presentation" />
 ```

### Issue 2: Poor Heading Structure
- **Location**: `filename.html:lines XX-YY`
- **Problem**: Headings not in logical order (h1, h2, h3, etc.)
- **Impact**: Screen reader users can't navigate content structure easily
- **Fix**:
 ```html
 <!-- Before (Problem) -->
 <div class="page-header">
 <div class="title">My Website</div>
 <div class="nav-items">
 <div class="nav-link">About</div>
 <div class="nav-link">Contact</div>
 </div>
 </div>

 <!-- After (Fixed) -->
 <header>
 <h1>My Website</h1>
 <nav aria-label="Main navigation">
 <ul>
 <li><a href="/about">About</a></li>
 <li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li>
 </ul>
 </nav>
 </header>
 ```

## Common Issues to Check

### Keyboard Navigation
- **Missing Focus Indicators**: Users can't see where they are when using keyboard
- **Keyboard Traps**: Users get stuck and can't navigate away
- **Poor Tab Order**: Navigation doesn't follow logical sequence
- **Missing Skip Links**: No way to skip repetitive navigation

### Visual Issues
- **Low Contrast**: Text is hard to read against background
- **Color-Only Information**: Important info conveyed only through color
- **Small Text**: Text too small to read comfortably
- **Poor Visual Hierarchy**: Hard to understand content structure

### Form Problems
- **Missing Labels**: Form inputs don't have clear labels
- **Unclear Errors**: Error messages are confusing or missing
- **Required Fields**: Not clearly marked which fields are required
- **Timeout Issues**: Forms expire too quickly

## Quick Improvements

### Easy Wins
- **Add Alt Text**: Describe images for screen readers
- **Use Proper Headings**: Structure content with h1, h2, h3, etc.
- **Label Form Inputs**: Every input needs a clear label
- **Improve Contrast**: Make text easier to read

### Navigation Improvements
- **Skip Links**: Add "Skip to main content" link
- **Focus Styles**: Make keyboard focus clearly visible

- **Command Line**: axe-core, Pa11y for automated testing

### Manual Testing

- **Keyboard Navigation**: Tab through entire site, ensure all functionality works
- **Screen Reader**: Test with NVDA (free), VoiceOver (Mac), or JAWS
- **Zoom Testing**: Test at 200% zoom, ensure content remains usable
- **Color Testing**: Use grayscale or color blindness simulators

### Success Indicators

## Tooling & Automation

Recommended tools and commands for frontend development:

### Analysis & Quality Tools
```bash
# Frontend code quality
eslint .
stylelint "**/*.css"
prettier --check .

# Accessibility
pa11y-ci
axe-cli
```

### Git Analysis
```bash
# Review changes
git diff main...HEAD --stat

```


## Metrics & Validation

Define clear success criteria for outcomes:

### Quality Guidelines
- **Security**: Zero critical vulnerabilities, zero hardcoded secrets
- **Code Quality**: ESLint and Stylelint passes with minimal warnings
- **Complexity**: Cyclomatic complexity <10 per function/method
- **Duplication**: No code blocks duplicated more than twice
- **Documentation**: Public APIs and complex logic documented

### Testing Thresholds
- **Critical paths**: 80% test coverage
- **All tests pass**: No failing tests without corresponding code changes
- **Test quality**: Tests verify behavior, not implementation details
- **Edge cases**: Error conditions and boundary cases tested

### Performance Benchmarks (if applicable)
- **No regressions**: Performance metrics maintained or improved
- **Response times**: Within acceptable thresholds for user-facing operations
- **Resource usage**: Memory and CPU usage within reasonable bounds
- **Scalability**: System handles expected load

### Deployment Readiness
- **Documentation**: README, API docs, and runbooks up-to-date
- **Monitoring**: Key metrics and errors are observable
- **Deployment**: Automated deployment process works reliably



## Follow-Up & Continuous Improvement

### Feedback Loop
After implementing changes:

1. **Verify improvements**
   - Run all tests to ensure nothing broke
   - Check that metrics improved (quality scores, performance)
   - Gather feedback from team members or users
   - Validate that issues are actually resolved

2. **Monitor impact**
   - Track if bugs decreased in modified areas
   - Measure if development velocity improved
   - Note if system reliability increased
   - Observe user satisfaction changes

3. **Document learnings**
   - Update team standards based on findings
   - Create architecture decision records (ADRs) for significant changes
   - Share successful patterns and approaches
   - Update documentation with new practices

### When to Get Team Input
When to discuss with your teammates:
- **Breaking changes needed**: Discuss with the team before making major changes
- **Performance degradation**: Roll back and investigate if metrics worsen significantly
- **Test coverage drops**: Pause changes to add tests first
- **Security concerns**: Pair with a teammate on authentication, authorization, or data handling code
- **Team confusion**: Provide additional documentation, pairing, or training

### Continuous Improvement
- Schedule regular reviews (weekly/monthly/quarterly based on project activity)
- Gradually increase quality standards as codebase improves
- Celebrate wins and improvements with the team
- Keep improvements incremental and sustainable
- Build a culture of quality and continuous learning

### Process Optimization
Based on findings, consider updating:
- **Coding standards**: Add patterns that prevent common issues
- **Review checklists**: Include checks for identified problem areas
- **CI/CD pipelines**: Add automated checks for recurring issues
- **Documentation templates**: Standardize important documentation
- **Team practices**: Share knowledge and establish better workflows
