## Common HTML/CSS Patterns

### Semantic HTML Structure
```html
<!-- Good semantic structure -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
 <meta charset="UTF-8">
 <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
 <title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>
 <header>
 <nav><!-- Navigation --></nav>
 </header>
 <main>
 <article>
 <h1>Main Heading</h1>
 <section>
 <h2>Section Heading</h2>
 <p>Content...</p>
 </section>
 </article>
 </main>
 <footer><!-- Footer content --></footer>
</body>
</html>
```

### Responsive CSS
```css
/* Mobile-first approach */
.container {
 width: 100%;
 padding: 1rem;
}

/* Tablet and up */
@media (min-width: 768px) {
 .container {
 max-width: 1200px;
 margin: 0 auto;
 padding: 2rem;
 }
}

/* Desktop */
@media (min-width: 1024px) {
 .container {
 padding: 3rem;
 }
}
```

### Accessible Components
```html
<!-- Good button with proper accessibility -->
<button 
 class="btn btn--primary" 
 aria-describedby="help-text"
 type="submit"
>
 Submit Form
</button>
<div id="help-text" class="help-text">
 This will save your changes
</div>

<!-- Good form with labels -->
<form>
 <label for="email">Email Address</label>
 <input 
 type="email" 
 id="email" 
 name="email" 
 required 
 aria-describedby="email-error"
 >
 <div id="email-error" class="error" role="alert">
 <!-- Error message appears here -->
 </div>
</form>
```




## Tooling & Automation

Recommended tools and commands for frontend development:

### Analysis & Quality Tools
```bash
# Frontend code quality
eslint .
stylelint "**/*.css"
prettier --check .

# Accessibility
pa11y-ci
axe-cli
```

### Git Analysis
```bash
# Review changes
git diff main...HEAD --stat
git log --oneline -10

# Identify changed files
git diff main...HEAD --name-only
```

### CI/CD Integration
Recommend adding these to your development workflow:
```bash
# Pre-commit hooks
pre-commit run eslint --all-files
pre-commit run prettier --all-files
```

### Pre-commit Hooks (Recommended)
```bash
# Install pre-commit framework
pip install pre-commit  # or brew install pre-commit

# Set up hooks
pre-commit install
pre-commit run --all-files
```


## Metrics & Validation

Define clear success criteria for outcomes:

### Quality Guidelines
- **Security**: Zero critical vulnerabilities, zero hardcoded secrets
- **Code Quality**: ESLint and Stylelint passes with minimal warnings
- **Complexity**: Cyclomatic complexity <10 per function/method
- **Duplication**: No code blocks duplicated more than twice
- **Documentation**: Public APIs and complex logic documented

### Testing Thresholds
- **Critical paths**: 80% test coverage
- **All tests pass**: No failing tests without corresponding code changes
- **Test quality**: Tests verify behavior, not implementation details
- **Edge cases**: Error conditions and boundary cases tested

### Performance Benchmarks (if applicable)
- **No regressions**: Performance metrics maintained or improved
- **Response times**: Within acceptable thresholds for user-facing operations
- **Resource usage**: Memory and CPU usage within reasonable bounds
- **Scalability**: System handles expected load

### Operational Readiness
- **Documentation**: README, API docs, and runbooks up-to-date
- **Monitoring**: Key metrics and errors are observable
- **Deployment**: Automated deployment process works reliably



## Follow-Up & Continuous Improvement

### Feedback Loop
After implementing changes:

1. **Verify improvements**
   - Run all tests to ensure nothing broke
   - Check that metrics improved (quality scores, performance)
   - Gather feedback from team members or users
   - Validate that issues are actually resolved

2. **Monitor impact**
   - Track if bugs decreased in modified areas
   - Measure if development velocity improved
   - Note if system reliability increased
   - Observe user satisfaction changes

3. **Document learnings**
   - Update team standards based on findings
   - Create architecture decision records (ADRs) for significant changes
   - Share successful patterns and approaches
   - Update documentation with new practices

### When to Get Team Input
When to discuss with your teammates:
- **Breaking changes needed**: Discuss with the team before making major changes
- **Performance degradation**: Roll back and investigate if metrics worsen significantly
- **Test coverage drops**: Pause changes to add tests first
- **Security concerns**: Pair with a teammate on authentication, authorization, or data handling code
- **Team confusion**: Provide additional documentation, pairing, or training

### Continuous Improvement
- Schedule regular reviews (weekly/monthly/quarterly based on project activity)
- Gradually increase quality standards as codebase improves
- Celebrate wins and improvements with the team
- Keep improvements incremental and sustainable
- Build a culture of quality and continuous learning

### Process Optimization
Based on findings, consider updating:
- **Coding standards**: Add patterns that prevent common issues
- **Review checklists**: Include checks for identified problem areas
- **CI/CD pipelines**: Add automated checks for recurring issues
- **Documentation templates**: Standardize important documentation
- **Team practices**: Share knowledge and establish better workflows
