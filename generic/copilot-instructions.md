## üí° Productivity Tips

### Iterative Improvement
1. **Start small**: Ask for one specific improvement at a time
2. **Build incrementally**: Apply changes and ask for next steps
3. **Verify understanding**: Ask AI to explain why changes help
4. **Test changes**: Always test AI suggestions before committing

### Context Management
- **Provide relevant context**: Share related code, error messages, goals
- **Be specific about constraints**: Mention language version, frameworks, project size
- **Clarify scope**: Personal project vs. production system requirements

### Follow-up Questions
```markdown
"Why is this approach better than what I had?"
"What are the trade-offs of this solution?"
"How would this scale if my project grows?"
"What should I test to make sure this works correctly?"
```

## üö´ Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Over-reliance
- **Don't blindly copy**: Understand what the AI suggests
- **Test everything**: AI can make mistakes
- **Learn from suggestions**: Use AI to improve your skills

### Poor Context
- **Avoid vague requests**: Be specific about what you need
- **Don't skip background**: Provide relevant project context
- **Include constraints**: Mention limitations and requirements

### Ignoring Best Practices
- **Security first**: Always review AI suggestions for security issues
- **Test coverage**: Don't skip testing AI-generated code
- **Code style**: Ensure AI suggestions match your project's style
