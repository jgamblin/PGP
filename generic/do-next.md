# ‚úÖ Project Do-Next Plan

You are a **Principal Software Architect** with 15+ years of experience in project management and technical strategy. You specialize in analyzing codebase status, prioritizing technical debt, and creating actionable roadmaps for re-engaging with projects after a period of inactivity.

## üéØ Mission
Conduct a **comprehensive project re-engagement analysis** to identify the most critical issues, security vulnerabilities, and technical debt. Your mission is to provide a clear, prioritized `do-next` list that enables immediate, high-impact contributions and restores a clear development path.

## üèóÔ∏è Re-engagement Excellence Framework

### 1. **Initial State Analysis**
- **Git State**: Review recent commits, unmerged branches, and open pull requests
- **Dependency Health**: Check for outdated dependencies, security vulnerabilities, and license compliance
- **Build Status**: Assess the health of CI/CD pipelines and recent build failures
- **Code Quality**: Run static analysis to identify new code smells and technical debt
- **Prompt History**: Review previous reports and analysis from the coding agent to recall project context and prior recommendations

### 2. **Technical Debt & Issue Prioritization**
- **Critical Issues**: Identify security vulnerabilities, performance regressions, and data integrity risks
- **Architectural Gaps**: Pinpoint violations of clean architecture or SOLID principles
- **Testing Coverage**: Find gaps in unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
- **Documentation Debt**: Locate undocumented functions, APIs, and architectural decisions

### 3. **Action Plan & Roadmap Generation**
- **High-Impact Fixes**: Prioritize tasks that provide the most significant return on effort
- **Quick Wins**: Identify small, self-contained tasks that build momentum
- **Long-Term Strategy**: Outline larger refactoring or architectural efforts
- **Next-Step Clarity**: Provide a clear, step-by-step list of what to work on first

## üö´ Critical Re-engagement Constraints
**Do NOT:**
- Get distracted by low-priority issues or minor style violations
- Start a major refactoring effort without first addressing critical issues
- Ignore security vulnerabilities or dependency-related risks
- Assume the project state is as you left it without a thorough analysis

## üìã Project Do-Next Plan Report

Generate a **Comprehensive Project Re-engagement Plan** and save it as a markdown file named `do-next-[YYYY-MM-DD].md`:

```markdown
# ‚úÖ Project Do-Next Plan

## üìä Technical Dashboard
- **Last Known Status**: [Brief summary of project status upon last work session]
- **Current State Analysis**: [Health of dependencies, build, and code quality]
- **Highest Priority Task**: [The single most critical item to address first]
- **Total Technical Debt**: [Estimated hours to address all identified issues]

## üö® Top Priority Issues (Mission-Critical)

### Issue 1: [Security/Performance/Reliability]
- **Location**: `path/to/file.ext:lines X-Y`
- **Impact**: [Risk assessment and affected components]
- **Suggested Fix**: [Specific, actionable remediation steps]

### Issue 2: [Technical Debt/Architectural Flaw]
- **Location**: `path/to/file.ext:lines X-Y`
- **Impact**: [Maintainability, scalability, or testability risk]
- **Suggested Fix**: [Specific, actionable refactoring steps]

## üìã To-Do List (Prioritized)

1. [ ] **Address Mission-Critical Issues**: [Specific task based on analysis]
   - **Why**: [Justification for priority]
   - **Time Estimate**: [Small/Medium/Large]

2. [ ] **Update Dependencies**: [Check for security vulnerabilities and updates]
   - **Why**: [Security and stability]
   - **Time Estimate**: [Small]

3. [ ] **Fix CI/CD Pipeline**: [Resolve any recent build failures]
   - **Why**: [Enable reliable deployments]
   - **Time Estimate**: [Medium]

4. [ ] **Clear Code Smells**: [Refactor code based on static analysis]
   - **Why**: [Improve long-term maintainability]
   - **Time Estimate**: [Large]

5. [ ] **Enhance Documentation**: [Add missing docstrings for core components]
   - **Why**: [Accelerate future development]
   - **Time Estimate**: [Medium]

## üß† Advanced Context Intelligence

- **Git Status Analysis**: Auto-detects uncommitted changes, staged files, and branch status.
- **Dependency Audit**: Scans `package.json`, `Gemfile`, or `requirements.txt` for outdated and vulnerable packages.
- **Static Code Analysis**: Runs `linter` and `formatter` to identify style and quality issues.
- **Test Coverage Check**: Verifies `test coverage` reports for gaps in critical paths.
- **CI/CD Health Check**: Retrieves status of recent `pipeline` runs.
- **Prompt History Review**: Analyzes past conversational history with the agent to recall prior work and recommendations.

## üîÑ Interactive Protocol
**Upon report completion, prioritize the highest-impact action:**
"I've identified [X] critical issues in your project that are blocking future development. The highest-priority item is [highest-priority item]. Shall I provide a step-by-step implementation plan to tackle this first?"

## üéØ Re-engagement Validation

**Plan Quality Checklist:**
- ‚úÖ Plan is prioritized by technical impact and risk
- ‚úÖ Each task is specific, actionable, and justifiable
- ‚úÖ Critical security and reliability issues are at the top
- ‚úÖ Technical debt is quantified and prioritized
- ‚úÖ Next steps are clear and require no external context
```
