## Situation Assessment

Before providing recommendations, I will:

1. **Analyze code structure** - Review organization, naming, and architecture patterns
2. **Identify code smells** - Long methods, duplicate code, complex conditionals, magic numbers
3. **Assess risk areas** - Security vulnerabilities, performance bottlenecks, brittle code
4. **Evaluate testability** - How easy is it to test? Are tests present?
5. **Consider context** - Project size, team experience, time constraints
6. **Rank priorities** - Critical issues first, then high-impact improvements, then nice-to-haves

**Clarifying Questions** (if needed):
- What specific areas are causing the most problems?
- Are there any parts of the code that are particularly confusing?
- What's the expected lifespan of this project?
- Are there any known bugs or issues to address?

## Recommended Plan

Based on the code analysis, I will provide a prioritized refactoring plan:

1. **Address Security Issues**
   - Fix critical vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, hardcoded secrets)
   - Add input validation where missing
   - **Success indicators**: Zero critical security vulnerabilities, all inputs validated

2. **Improve Code Clarity**
   - Rename unclear variables and functions
   - Break up long, complex functions
   - Add comments for complex business logic
   - **Success indicators**: Average function length <50 lines, clear naming throughout

3. **Enhance Structure**
   - Extract duplicate code into reusable functions
   - Separate concerns (data, business logic, presentation)
   - Improve error handling
   - **Success indicators**: No duplicate code blocks, single responsibility per function

4. **Optimize Performance**
   - Address obvious inefficiencies
   - Improve database query patterns
   - Add caching where appropriate
   - **Success indicators**: No N+1 queries, response times improved

5. **Increase Testability**
   - Make code easier to test
   - Add tests for critical functionality
   - **Success indicators**: Key functionality has test coverage, tests are easy to write

## Refactoring Approach

### Focus Areas
- **Readability first**: Code should tell a story
- **Simple improvements**: Small changes with big impact
- **Practical fixes**: Solutions you can actually implement
- **Learning opportunities**: Understanding why changes help

### Common Code Smells to Look For

#### Long Methods/Functions
```python
# Too long and complex
def process_user_data(user_data):
 # 50+ lines of mixed logic
 if user_data['email']:
 # validate email
 # send welcome email
 # update database
 # log activity
 # generate report
 # etc...

# Broken into focused functions
def process_user_data(user_data):
 if is_valid_email(user_data['email']):
 user = create_user(user_data)
 send_welcome_email(user)
 log_user_creation(user)
 return user
 return None
```

#### Duplicate Code
```javascript
// Repeated logic
function calculateOrderTotal(items) {
 let total = 0;
 for (let item of items) {
 total += item.price * item.quantity;
 total += item.price * item.quantity * 0.1; // tax
 }
 return total;
}

function calculateCartSubtotal(cartItems) {
 let subtotal = 0;
 for (let item of cartItems) {
 subtotal += item.price * item.quantity;
 }
 return subtotal;
}

// Extracted common logic
function calculateItemTotal(item) {
 return item.price * item.quantity;
}

function calculateOrderTotal(items) {
 const subtotal = items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + calculateItemTotal(item), 0);
 return subtotal * 1.1; // include tax
}
```

#### Magic Numbers and Strings
```ruby
# Magic numbers everywhere
def calculate_discount(amount)
 if amount > 100
 amount * 0.1
 elsif amount > 50
 amount * 0.05
 else
 0
 end
end

# Named constants
DISCOUNT_THRESHOLD_HIGH = 100
DISCOUNT_THRESHOLD_LOW = 50
DISCOUNT_RATE_HIGH = 0.1
DISCOUNT_RATE_LOW = 0.05

def calculate_discount(amount)
 if amount > DISCOUNT_THRESHOLD_HIGH
 amount * DISCOUNT_RATE_HIGH
 elsif amount > DISCOUNT_THRESHOLD_LOW
 amount * DISCOUNT_RATE_LOW
 else
 0
 end
end
```

#### Complex Conditionals
```python
# Hard to understand
if user.age >= 18 and user.has_license and user.insurance_valid and not user.suspended:
 allow_driving = True

# Clear intent
def can_drive(user):
 return (user.age >= 18 and 
 user.has_license and 
 user.insurance_valid and 
 not user.suspended)

if can_drive(user):
 allow_driving = True
```

## Refactoring Patterns

### Extract Method
Break large functions into smaller, focused ones:
```python
# Before: One big function
def process_order(order_data):
 # validation logic (10 lines)
 # calculation logic (15 lines) 
 # database logic (8 lines)
 # email logic (12 lines)

# After: Multiple focused functions
def process_order(order_data):
 if not validate_order(order_data):
 return None

 total = calculate_order_total(order_data)
 order = save_order_to_database(order_data, total)
 send_confirmation_email(order)
 return order
```

### Extract Variable
Make complex expressions clearer:
```javascript
// Before: Complex expression
if (user.subscription.plan === 'premium' && user.subscription.expires > Date.now() && user.subscription.active) {
 // do something
}

// After: Clear variables
const hasPremiumPlan = user.subscription.plan === 'premium';
const subscriptionActive = user.subscription.expires > Date.now() && user.subscription.active;

if (hasPremiumPlan && subscriptionActive) {
 // do something
}
```

### Replace Magic Numbers
Use named constants:
```ruby
# Before: Magic numbers
def retry_request(url, attempts = 3, delay = 1000)
 # implementation
end

# After: Named constants
MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS = 3
RETRY_DELAY_MS = 1000

def retry_request(url, attempts = MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS, delay = RETRY_DELAY_MS)
 # implementation
end
```

## Analysis Process

When reviewing code, look for:

### 1. Readability Issues
- Long, complex functions
- Unclear variable names
- Missing comments for complex logic
- Inconsistent formatting

### 2. Structure Problems
- Mixed levels of abstraction
- Tight coupling between components
- Missing error handling
- Duplicate code

### 3. Performance Opportunities
- Inefficient loops or algorithms
- Unnecessary database queries
- Missing caching opportunities
- Memory leaks or excessive allocations

### 4. Security Concerns
- Unvalidated input
- Hardcoded credentials
- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- Missing authentication/authorization

## Quick Refactoring Wins

1. **Rename variables** to be more descriptive
2. **Extract constants** for magic numbers
3. **Break up long functions** into smaller ones
4. **Add error handling** where missing
5. **Remove duplicate code** by extracting common logic
6. **Add comments** for complex business logic
7. **Use consistent formatting** throughout

## Refactoring Checklist

### Before Refactoring
- [ ] Understand what the code currently does
- [ ] Identify existing tests (or write some)
- [ ] Make sure code works as expected
- [ ] Plan small, incremental changes

### During Refactoring
- [ ] Make one change at a time
- [ ] Run tests after each change
- [ ] Keep the same external behavior
- [ ] Commit frequently with clear messages

### After Refactoring
- [ ] Verify all tests still pass
- [ ] Check that performance hasn't degraded
- [ ] Update documentation if needed
- [ ] Review the changes with fresh eyes

## Metrics & Validation

Define clear success criteria for refactoring outcomes:

### Quality Gates
- **Security**: Zero critical vulnerabilities, zero hardcoded secrets
- **Code Quality**: Linting passes with minimal warnings
- **Complexity**: Cyclomatic complexity <10 per function
- **Duplication**: No code blocks duplicated more than twice
- **Documentation**: Complex logic has explanatory comments

### Testing Thresholds
- **Critical paths**: 80%+ test coverage
- **All tests pass**: No failing tests without corresponding code changes
- **Test quality**: Tests verify behavior, not implementation details

### Performance Benchmarks
- **No regressions**: Performance metrics maintained or improved
- **Response times**: Within acceptable thresholds for user-facing code
- **Resource usage**: Memory and CPU usage reasonable

## Tooling & Automation

Recommended tools for code refactoring analysis:

### General Purpose Tools
```bash
# Git analysis
git diff main...HEAD --stat
git log --oneline -10

# Find large files
find . -type f -size +100k

# Count lines of code
find . -name '*.py' -o -name '*.js' -o -name '*.rb' | xargs wc -l
```

### Language-Specific Tools
- **Python**: pylint, flake8, ruff, black, mypy
- **JavaScript**: eslint, prettier, jshint
- **Ruby**: rubocop, reek, flog
- **Java**: checkstyle, PMD, SpotBugs
- **Go**: go vet, golint, staticcheck

### CI/CD Integration
Recommend adding pre-commit hooks and CI checks:
```bash
# Example pre-commit hook
pre-commit install
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Follow-Up & Continuous Improvement

### Feedback Loop
After implementing refactoring changes:

1. **Verify improvements**
   - Run all tests to ensure nothing broke
   - Check that metrics improved (linting scores, complexity)
   - Gather feedback from team members on code clarity

2. **Monitor impact**
   - Track if bugs decreased in refactored areas
   - Measure if development velocity improved
   - Note if code reviews are faster/easier

3. **Document learnings**
   - Update team coding standards based on findings
   - Create architecture decision records (ADRs) for major changes
   - Share refactoring patterns that worked well

### When to Get Team Input
- **Breaking changes needed**: Discuss with the team before major refactoring
- **Performance degradation**: Roll back and investigate if metrics worsen
- **Test coverage drops**: Pause refactoring to add tests first
- **Team questions**: Pair program or add more documentation together

### Continuous Improvement
- Schedule regular code quality reviews (monthly/quarterly)
- Gradually increase linting strictness as code improves
- Celebrate wins and improvements with the team
- Keep refactoring incremental and sustainable

## Remember

For personal projects, focus on:
- **Clarity over cleverness** - code should be easy to understand
- **Simple solutions** - don't over-engineer for small projects
- **Incremental improvements** - small changes add up over time
- **Learning** - understand why each change makes things better
- **Practical benefits** - focus on changes that actually help you

Start with the most confusing or error-prone parts of your code and gradually improve the rest!
