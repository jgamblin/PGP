## Common Pipeline Patterns

### Basic GitHub Actions Workflow
```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
 push:
 branches: [ main, develop ]
 pull_request:
 branches: [ main ]

jobs:
 test:
 runs-on: ubuntu-latest

 steps:
 - uses: actions/checkout@v4

 - name: Setup Node.js
 uses: actions/setup-node@v4
 with:
 node-version: '18'
 cache: 'npm'

 - name: Install dependencies
 run: npm ci

 - name: Run tests
 run: npm test

 - name: Run linting
 run: npm run lint

 deploy:
 needs: test
 runs-on: ubuntu-latest
 if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'

 steps:
 - uses: actions/checkout@v4

 - name: Deploy to production
 run: |
 echo "Deploying to production..."
 # Add your deployment commands here
```

### Python Project Example
```yaml
name: Python CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
 test:
 runs-on: ubuntu-latest
 strategy:
 matrix:
 python-version: [3.9, 3.10, 3.11]

 steps:
 - uses: actions/checkout@v4

 - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
 uses: actions/setup-python@v4
 with:
 python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}

 - name: Install dependencies
 run: |
 python -m pip install --upgrade pip
 pip install -r requirements.txt
 pip install pytest pytest-cov

 - name: Run tests
 run: |
 pytest --cov=src tests/

 - name: Upload coverage
 uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
```

### Ruby/Rails Example
```yaml
name: Ruby CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
 test:
 runs-on: ubuntu-latest

 services:
 postgres:
 image: postgres:13
 env:
 POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
 options: >-
 --health-cmd pg_isready
 --health-interval 10s
 --health-timeout 5s
 --health-retries 5

 steps:
 - uses: actions/checkout@v4

 - name: Set up Ruby
 uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1
 with:
 ruby-version: 3.1
 bundler-cache: true

 - name: Setup database
 env:
 DATABASE_URL: postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/test
 run: |
 bundle exec rails db:create
 bundle exec rails db:migrate

 - name: Run tests
 env:
 DATABASE_URL: postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/test
 run: bundle exec rspec
```

## Security Best Practices

### Secrets Management
```yaml
# Good - Using GitHub Secrets
- name: Deploy
 env:
 API_KEY: ${{ secrets.API_KEY }}
 DATABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.DATABASE_URL }}
 run: ./deploy.sh

# Bad - Hardcoded secrets
- name: Deploy
 env:
 API_KEY: "sk-1234567890abcdef" # Never do this!
 run: ./deploy.sh
```

### Dependency Security
```yaml
# Add dependency scanning
- name: Run security audit
 run: |
 npm audit --audit-level high
 # or for Python: pip-audit
 # or for Ruby: bundle audit
```

### Permissions
```yaml
# Limit permissions
permissions:
 contents: read
 pull-requests: write
 checks: write
```

## Performance Tips

### Caching Dependencies
```yaml
# Node.js caching
- name: Setup Node.js
 uses: actions/setup-node@v4
 with:
 node-version: '18'
 cache: 'npm' # Automatic caching

# Manual caching example
- name: Cache dependencies
 uses: actions/cache@v3
 with:
 path: ~/.npm
 key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
 restore-keys: |
 ${{ runner.os }}-node-
```

### Parallel Jobs
```yaml
jobs:
 test:
 strategy:
 matrix:
 os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest]
 node-version: [16, 18, 20]
 runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
```

### Skip Unnecessary Runs
```yaml
on:
 push:
 branches: [ main ]
 paths-ignore:
 - '**.md'
 - 'docs/**'
```

## Simple Deployment Strategies

### Static Site Deployment
```yaml
- name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
 uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
 with:
 github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
 publish_dir: ./dist
```

### Docker Deployment
```yaml
- name: Build and push Docker image
 uses: docker/build-push-action@v4
 with:
 context: .
 push: true
 tags: myapp:latest
```

### Simple Server Deployment
```yaml
- name: Deploy via SSH
 uses: appleboy/ssh-action@v0.1.5
 with:
 host: ${{ secrets.HOST }}
 username: ${{ secrets.USERNAME }}
 key: ${{ secrets.KEY }}
 script: |
 cd /path/to/app
 git pull origin main
 npm install --production
 pm2 restart app
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Slow Builds
- **Cache dependencies** (npm, pip, bundler)
- **Use matrix builds** for parallel testing
- **Skip unnecessary steps** with path filters
- **Optimize Docker layers** if using containers

### Flaky Tests
- **Add retry logic** for network-dependent tests
- **Use test databases** instead of shared resources
- **Set proper timeouts** for async operations
- **Mock external services** in tests

### Failed Deployments
- **Add health checks** after deployment
- **Use staging environments** for testing
- **Implement rollback strategies**
- **Add proper error notifications**

```bash
# Language-specific tools
# Add linting, formatting, testing commands
```

### Git Analysis
```bash
# Review changes
git diff main...HEAD --stat
git log --oneline -10

# Identify changed files
git diff main...HEAD --name-only
```

### CI/CD Integration
Recommend adding these to your development workflow:
```bash
# Add CI/CD pipeline commands
# pre-commit, automated testing, etc.
```

### Pre-commit Hooks (Recommended)
```bash
# Install pre-commit framework
pip install pre-commit  # or brew install pre-commit

# Set up hooks
pre-commit install
pre-commit run --all-files
```


## Metrics & Validation

Define clear success criteria for outcomes:

### Quality Gates
- **Security**: Zero critical vulnerabilities, zero hardcoded secrets
- **Code Quality**: Language-specific linter passes with minimal warnings
- **Complexity**: Cyclomatic complexity <10 per function/method
- **Duplication**: No code blocks duplicated more than twice
- **Documentation**: Public APIs and complex logic documented

### Testing Thresholds
- **Critical paths**: 80% test coverage
- **All tests pass**: No failing tests without corresponding code changes
- **Test quality**: Tests verify behavior, not implementation details
- **Edge cases**: Error conditions and boundary cases tested

### Performance Benchmarks (if applicable)
- **No regressions**: Performance metrics maintained or improved
- **Response times**: Within acceptable thresholds for user-facing operations
- **Resource usage**: Memory and CPU usage within reasonable bounds
- **Scalability**: System handles expected load

### Operational Readiness
- **Documentation**: README, API docs, and runbooks up-to-date
- **Monitoring**: Key metrics and errors are observable
- **Deployment**: Automated deployment process works reliably



## Follow-Up & Continuous Improvement

### Feedback Loop
After implementing changes:

1. **Verify improvements**
   - Run all tests to ensure nothing broke
   - Check that metrics improved (quality scores, performance)
   - Gather feedback from team members or users
   - Validate that issues are actually resolved

2. **Monitor impact**
   - Track if bugs decreased in modified areas
   - Measure if development velocity improved
   - Note if system reliability increased
   - Observe user satisfaction changes

3. **Document learnings**
   - Update team standards based on findings
   - Create architecture decision records (ADRs) for significant changes
   - Share successful patterns and approaches
   - Update documentation with new practices

### When to Get Team Input
When to discuss with your teammates:
- **Breaking changes needed**: Discuss with the team before making major changes
- **Performance degradation**: Roll back and investigate if metrics worsen significantly
- **Test coverage drops**: Pause changes to add tests first
- **Security concerns**: Pair with a teammate on authentication, authorization, or data handling code
- **Team confusion**: Provide additional documentation, pairing, or training

### Continuous Improvement
- Schedule regular reviews (weekly/monthly/quarterly based on project activity)
- Gradually increase quality standards as codebase improves
- Celebrate wins and improvements with the team
- Keep improvements incremental and sustainable
- Build a culture of quality and continuous learning

### Process Optimization
Based on findings, consider updating:
- **Coding standards**: Add patterns that prevent common issues
- **Review checklists**: Include checks for identified problem areas
- **CI/CD pipelines**: Add automated checks for recurring issues
- **Documentation templates**: Standardize important documentation
- **Team practices**: Share knowledge and establish better workflows


## Remember

For personal projects, focus on:
- **Getting it working** first, optimize later
- **Security basics** - secrets and dependency scanning
- **Simple deployments** - don't over-engineer
- **Fast feedback** - quick builds and clear errors
- **Learning** - experiment with new tools and patterns

Start with a basic workflow and gradually add features as your project grows!
