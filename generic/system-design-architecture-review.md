## Common Architecture Patterns

### Web Application Architecture
```
[Frontend] → [Load Balancer] → [Web Server] → [Application] → [Database]
 ↓
 [Cache Layer]
 ↓
 [Background Jobs]
```

**Key Considerations:**
- **Frontend**: React, Vue, Angular - how does it communicate with backend?
- **Load Balancer**: Nginx, AWS ALB - distributes traffic
- **Web Server**: Express, Flask, Rails - handles HTTP requests
- **Application**: Business logic - is it well organized?
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB - is the schema well designed?
- **Cache**: Redis, Memcached - what should be cached?
- **Background Jobs**: Celery, Sidekiq - for async processing

### Microservices Architecture
```
[API Gateway] → [User Service]
 → [Order Service] → [Payment Service]
 → [Notification Service]
 ↓
 [Message Queue]
```

**Key Considerations:**
- **Service Boundaries**: Are services well-defined and independent?
- **Communication**: REST APIs, GraphQL, message queues
- **Data**: Each service should own its data
- **Deployment**: Can services be deployed independently?
- **Monitoring**: How do you track requests across services?

### Simple Monolith Architecture
```
[Web Interface] → [Application Server] → [Database]
 ↓
 [File Storage]
```

**Key Considerations:**
- **Simplicity**: Easy to develop, test, and deploy
- **Organization**: Clear separation of concerns within the app
- **Database**: Well-designed schema and queries
- **Scaling**: Vertical scaling, read replicas

## Common Architecture Issues

### Database Problems
```sql
-- Bad: N+1 query problem
SELECT * FROM users;
-- Then for each user:
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE user_id = ?;

-- Good: Join or batch query
SELECT u.*, o.* FROM users u 
LEFT JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id;
```

### Tight Coupling
```python
# Bad: Direct database access in controller
def get_user_orders(user_id):
 user = db.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?", user_id)
 orders = db.query("SELECT * FROM orders WHERE user_id = ?", user_id)
 return {"user": user, "orders": orders}

# Good: Service layer
class UserService:
 def get_user_with_orders(self, user_id):
 user = self.user_repository.find(user_id)
 orders = self.order_repository.find_by_user(user_id)
 return UserWithOrders(user, orders)
```

### Missing Error Handling
```javascript
// Bad: No error handling
app.get('/api/users/:id', (req, res) => {
 const user = database.getUser(req.params.id);
 res.json(user);
});

// Good: Proper error handling
app.get('/api/users/:id', async (req, res) => {
 try {
 const user = await database.getUser(req.params.id);
 if (!user) {
 return res.status(404).json({ error: 'User not found' });
 }
 res.json(user);
 } catch (error) {
 console.error('Error fetching user:', error);
 res.status(500).json({ error: 'Internal server error' });
 }
});
```

## Architecture Review Tips

### Focus on the Essentials
- **Correctness**: Does the design solve the problem?
- **Simplicity**: Is it as simple as possible but not simpler?
- **Scalability**: Can it handle expected growth?
- **Security**: Are the basics covered?
- **Maintainability**: Can it be easily modified?

### Ask Good Questions
- "What happens if this component fails?"
- "How will this scale with more users?"
- "Where are the security vulnerabilities?"
- "How easy is it to add new features?"
- "What are the operational requirements?"

### Provide Actionable Feedback
- Be specific about issues and solutions
- Prioritize problems by impact and effort
- Suggest concrete next steps
- Include code examples when helpful
- Consider the project's constraints



## Tooling & Automation

Recommended tools and commands for software development:

### Analysis & Quality Tools
```bash
# Language-specific tools
# Add linting, formatting, testing commands
```

### Git Analysis
```bash
# Review changes
git diff main...HEAD --stat
git log --oneline -10

# Identify changed files
git diff main...HEAD --name-only
```

### CI/CD Integration
Recommend adding these to your development workflow:
```bash
# Add CI/CD pipeline commands
# pre-commit, automated testing, etc.
```

### Pre-commit Hooks (Recommended)
```bash
# Install pre-commit framework
pip install pre-commit  # or brew install pre-commit

# Set up hooks
pre-commit install
pre-commit run --all-files
```


## Metrics & Validation

Define clear success criteria for outcomes:

### Quality Gates
- **Security**: Zero critical vulnerabilities, zero hardcoded secrets
- **Code Quality**: Language-specific linter passes with minimal warnings
- **Complexity**: Cyclomatic complexity <10 per function/method
- **Duplication**: No code blocks duplicated more than twice
- **Documentation**: Public APIs and complex logic documented

### Testing Thresholds
- **Critical paths**: 80% test coverage
- **All tests pass**: No failing tests without corresponding code changes
- **Test quality**: Tests verify behavior, not implementation details
- **Edge cases**: Error conditions and boundary cases tested

### Performance Benchmarks (if applicable)
- **No regressions**: Performance metrics maintained or improved
- **Response times**: Within acceptable thresholds for user-facing operations
- **Resource usage**: Memory and CPU usage within reasonable bounds
- **Scalability**: System handles expected load

### Operational Readiness
- **Documentation**: README, API docs, and runbooks up-to-date
- **Monitoring**: Key metrics and errors are observable
- **Deployment**: Automated deployment process works reliably



## Follow-Up & Continuous Improvement

### Feedback Loop
After implementing changes:

1. **Verify improvements**
   - Run all tests to ensure nothing broke
   - Check that metrics improved (quality scores, performance)
   - Gather feedback from team members or users
   - Validate that issues are actually resolved

2. **Monitor impact**
   - Track if bugs decreased in modified areas
   - Measure if development velocity improved
   - Note if system reliability increased
   - Observe user satisfaction changes

3. **Document learnings**
   - Update team standards based on findings
   - Create architecture decision records (ADRs) for significant changes
   - Share successful patterns and approaches
   - Update documentation with new practices

### When to Get Team Input
When to discuss with your teammates:
- **Breaking changes needed**: Discuss with the team before making major changes
- **Performance degradation**: Roll back and investigate if metrics worsen significantly
- **Test coverage drops**: Pause changes to add tests first
- **Security concerns**: Pair with a teammate on authentication, authorization, or data handling code
- **Team confusion**: Provide additional documentation, pairing, or training

### Continuous Improvement
- Schedule regular reviews (weekly/monthly/quarterly based on project activity)
- Gradually increase quality standards as codebase improves
- Celebrate wins and improvements with the team
- Keep improvements incremental and sustainable
- Build a culture of quality and continuous learning

### Process Optimization
Based on findings, consider updating:
- **Coding standards**: Add patterns that prevent common issues
- **Review checklists**: Include checks for identified problem areas
- **CI/CD pipelines**: Add automated checks for recurring issues
- **Documentation templates**: Standardize important documentation
- **Team practices**: Share knowledge and establish better workflows


## Remember

For personal projects:
- **Start simple** - Don't over-engineer from the beginning
- **Focus on core functionality** - Get the basics right first
- **Plan for growth** - But don't build for scale you don't need yet
- **Security matters** - Even for small projects
- **Document decisions** - Your future self will thank you
- **Iterate and improve** - Architecture can evolve

Good architecture makes development faster and more enjoyable!
