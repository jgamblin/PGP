## 🛠️ Common Architecture Patterns

### Web Application Architecture
```
[Frontend] → [Load Balancer] → [Web Server] → [Application] → [Database]
                                    ↓
                              [Cache Layer]
                                    ↓
                            [Background Jobs]
```

**Key Considerations:**
- **Frontend**: React, Vue, Angular - how does it communicate with backend?
- **Load Balancer**: Nginx, AWS ALB - distributes traffic
- **Web Server**: Express, Flask, Rails - handles HTTP requests
- **Application**: Business logic - is it well organized?
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB - is the schema well designed?
- **Cache**: Redis, Memcached - what should be cached?
- **Background Jobs**: Celery, Sidekiq - for async processing

### Microservices Architecture
```
[API Gateway] → [User Service]
              → [Order Service] → [Payment Service]
              → [Notification Service]
                       ↓
                [Message Queue]
```

**Key Considerations:**
- **Service Boundaries**: Are services well-defined and independent?
- **Communication**: REST APIs, GraphQL, message queues
- **Data**: Each service should own its data
- **Deployment**: Can services be deployed independently?
- **Monitoring**: How do you track requests across services?

### Simple Monolith Architecture
```
[Web Interface] → [Application Server] → [Database]
                        ↓
                  [File Storage]
```

**Key Considerations:**
- **Simplicity**: Easy to develop, test, and deploy
- **Organization**: Clear separation of concerns within the app
- **Database**: Well-designed schema and queries
- **Scaling**: Vertical scaling, read replicas

## 🧪 Common Architecture Issues

### Database Problems
```sql
-- Bad: N+1 query problem
SELECT * FROM users;
-- Then for each user:
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE user_id = ?;

-- Good: Join or batch query
SELECT u.*, o.* FROM users u 
LEFT JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id;
```

### Tight Coupling
```python
# Bad: Direct database access in controller
def get_user_orders(user_id):
    user = db.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?", user_id)
    orders = db.query("SELECT * FROM orders WHERE user_id = ?", user_id)
    return {"user": user, "orders": orders}

# Good: Service layer
class UserService:
    def get_user_with_orders(self, user_id):
        user = self.user_repository.find(user_id)
        orders = self.order_repository.find_by_user(user_id)
        return UserWithOrders(user, orders)
```

### Missing Error Handling
```javascript
// Bad: No error handling
app.get('/api/users/:id', (req, res) => {
  const user = database.getUser(req.params.id);
  res.json(user);
});

// Good: Proper error handling
app.get('/api/users/:id', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const user = await database.getUser(req.params.id);
    if (!user) {
      return res.status(404).json({ error: 'User not found' });
    }
    res.json(user);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching user:', error);
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Internal server error' });
  }
});
```

## 💡 Architecture Review Tips

### Focus on the Essentials
- **Correctness**: Does the design solve the problem?
- **Simplicity**: Is it as simple as possible but not simpler?
- **Scalability**: Can it handle expected growth?
- **Security**: Are the basics covered?
- **Maintainability**: Can it be easily modified?

### Ask Good Questions
- "What happens if this component fails?"
- "How will this scale with more users?"
- "Where are the security vulnerabilities?"
- "How easy is it to add new features?"
- "What are the operational requirements?"

### Provide Actionable Feedback
- Be specific about issues and solutions
- Prioritize problems by impact and effort
- Suggest concrete next steps
- Include code examples when helpful
- Consider the project's constraints

## 🎯 Remember

For personal projects:
- **Start simple** - Don't over-engineer from the beginning
- **Focus on core functionality** - Get the basics right first
- **Plan for growth** - But don't build for scale you don't need yet
- **Security matters** - Even for small projects
- **Document decisions** - Your future self will thank you
- **Iterate and improve** - Architecture can evolve

Good architecture makes development faster and more enjoyable!
