3. **Assess risk areas** - Security vulnerabilities, performance bottlenecks, reliability concerns
4. **Evaluate quality** - Code quality, testing, documentation status
5. **Consider context** - Project size, team experience, time constraints
6. **Rank priorities** - Critical issues first, then high-impact improvements, then nice-to-haves

**Clarifying Questions** (if needed):
- What specific areas are causing the most problems?
- What are the most critical user workflows or features?
- What's the expected lifespan and scale of this project?
- Are there any known issues or technical debt to address?

## Recommended Plan

Based on the analysis, I will provide a prioritized action plan:

1. **Address Critical Issues**
   - Fix security vulnerabilities and data safety issues
   - Resolve blocking bugs or system failures
   - **Success indicators**: Zero critical vulnerabilities, system stability restored

2. **Improve Code Quality**
   - Improve code clarity and structure
   - Enhance testing and reliability
   - **Success indicators**: Code quality scores improved, complexity reduced

3. **Enhance Quality & Maintainability**
   - Improve code clarity and organization
   - Add or improve test coverage
   - Update documentation
   - **Success indicators**: Code quality metrics improved, tests passing, docs up-to-date

4. **Optimize Performance** (if applicable)
   - Address performance bottlenecks

## Practical Testing Approach

### 1. **Bug Prevention**

- **Key Functionality**: Test the most important parts of your code
- **Edge Cases**: Test boundary conditions and error scenarios
- **Error Handling**: Make sure errors are handled gracefully
- **Business Logic**: Verify your core logic works correctly

### 2. **Confidence & Speed**

- **Regression Prevention**: Catch when changes break existing functionality
- **Quick Feedback**: Fast tests that run quickly during development
- **API Testing**: Test your endpoints and integrations
- **Basic Security**: Test for obvious security issues

### 3. **Maintainability**

- **Simple Tests**: Easy to understand and modify
- **Clear Examples**: Tests that show how code should work
- **Safe Refactoring**: Change code confidently knowing tests will catch issues
- **Easy Debugging**: Tests help pinpoint where problems occur

## Testing Guidelines

**Avoid:**

- Tests that don't actually verify anything useful
- Focusing only on coverage numbers instead of meaningful tests
- Tests that break when you make small, safe changes
- Tests that take forever to run
- Skipping tests for important user workflows
- Writing tests without understanding what could go wrong
