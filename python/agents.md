# Python Assistant Prompts

## Purpose
This folder contains Python helper prompts designed for personal projects and proof-of-concept development. These assistants provide practical guidance on Python code quality, testing, documentation, and common improvements.

## Available Assistants
- **Code Helper**: Practical code improvements and refactoring suggestions
- **Testing Assistant**: Simple test patterns and pytest guidance
- **Type Hints Assistant**: Basic type annotations for better code clarity
- **Code Review Assistant**: Helpful feedback on Python code quality
- **Documentation Assistant**: Clear docstrings and project documentation
- **Database & ORM Assistant**: Common database and ORM optimization tips

## How to Use These Prompts
1. Choose the assistant that matches your needs (e.g., type-hinting.md for adding type hints)
2. Focus on practical improvements that make your code more maintainable
3. Start with small, incremental changes rather than major rewrites
4. Prioritize readability and bug prevention over complex optimizations
5. Test changes to make sure they work as expected

## Best Practices
- Start with the most impactful improvements first
- Keep solutions simple and easy to understand
- Add type hints gradually to improve code clarity
- Write tests for important functionality
- Document your code so you can understand it later

## Typical Workflow
1. Review current Python code structure
2. Identify areas for improvement (bugs, unclear code, missing tests)
3. Make targeted improvements with clear explanations
4. Add or update tests to cover changes
5. Document decisions and patterns for future reference
