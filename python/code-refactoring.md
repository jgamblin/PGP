 - **Coupling Issues**: [Functions/classes too tightly connected]
 - **Clarity Problems**: [Hard to understand parts]
 - **Suggested Pattern**: [Simple, clear organization]
 - **Improvement Steps**: [Easy changes to make it better]

2. **Design Principles**
 - **Single Purpose**: [Functions doing too many things]
 - **Easy to Extend**: [Hard to add new features]
 - **Clear Interfaces**: [Confusing function signatures]
 - **Dependencies**: [Too many interconnected parts]

### Code Quality Review

#### Top Priority Issues
1. **Security Concerns**
 - **Type**: [SQL Injection/XSS/Buffer Overflow]
 - **Location**: `filename.ext:line X-Y`
 - **Risk Assessment**: [CVSS score if applicable]
 - **Current Code**:
 ```python
 # Vulnerable code example
 def unsafe_query(user_input):
 query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_input}"
 return db.execute(query).fetchall()
 ```
 - **Secure Implementation**:
 ```python
 # Secure refactored version
 from sqlalchemy import text

 def safe_query(user_input: int) -> List[User]:
 query = text("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = :user_id")
 return db.execute(query, {"user_id": user_input}).fetchall()
 ```
 - **Additional Security Measures**: [Input validation, sanitization]

2. **Performance Issues**
 - **Slow Algorithms**: [Simple optimizations available]
 - **Memory Usage**: [Patterns using too much memory]
 - **Database Queries**: [N+1 problems and slow queries]
 - **Caching**: [Simple caching opportunities]

#### Quick Wins (High Impact)
1. **List Comprehensions and Generator Expressions**
 - **Current Issue**: Explicit loops for simple transformations
 - **Simple Fix**: Use list comprehensions or generator expressions
 - **Example**:
 ```python
 # Before: Explicit loop
 results = []
 for item in items:
 if item.is_active:
 results.append(item.name.upper())

 # After: List comprehension
 results = [item.name.upper() for item in items if item.is_active]

 # For large datasets: Generator expression
 results = (item.name.upper() for item in items if item.is_active)
 ```
 - **Benefits**: More readable, often faster, more Pythonic

2. **Dataclasses Instead of Simple Classes**
 - **Current Issue**: Boilerplate code for simple data containers
 - **Simple Fix**: Replace with dataclasses or NamedTuples
 - **Example**:
 ```python
 # Before: Manual class with boilerplate
 class User:
 def __init__(self, name, email, age):
 self.name = name
 self.email = email
 self.age = age

 def __repr__(self):
 return f"User(name='{self.name}', email='{self.email}', age={self.age})"

 # After: Dataclass
 from dataclasses import dataclass

 @dataclass
 class User:
 name: str
 email: str
 age: int
 ```
 - **Benefits**: Less code, automatic __repr__, type hints, equality methods

3. **Context Managers for Resource Handling**
 - **Current Issue**: Manual resource management and cleanup
 - **Simple Fix**: Use `with` statements and context managers
 - **Example**:
 ```python
 # Before: Manual file handling
 file = open('data.txt', 'r')
 try:
 content = file.read()
 process_content(content)
 finally:
 file.close()

 # After: Context manager
 with open('data.txt', 'r') as file:
 content = file.read()
 process_content(content)

 # Custom context manager for database connections
 from contextlib import contextmanager

 @contextmanager
 def database_transaction():
 conn = get_connection()
 trans = conn.begin()
 try:
 yield conn
 trans.commit()
 except Exception:
 trans.rollback()
 raise
 finally:
 conn.close()
 ```
 - **Benefits**: Guaranteed cleanup, exception safety, cleaner code

4. **Modern Python Features**
 - **f-strings**: Replace `.format()` and `%` formatting
 - **Type hints**: Add basic type annotations
 - **Pathlib**: Replace `os.path` operations
 - **Example**:
 ```python
 # Before: Old string formatting
 message = "Hello {}, you have {} messages".format(user.name, count)

 # After: f-strings
 message = f"Hello {user.name}, you have {count} messages"

 # Before: os.path
 import os
 file_path = os.path.join(base_dir, 'data', 'file.txt')

 # After: pathlib
 from pathlib import Path
 file_path = Path(base_dir) / 'data' / 'file.txt'
 ```

### Testing & Quality

#### Test Coverage Check
- **Unit Tests**: [Current coverage and missing areas]
- **Integration Tests**: [API and database testing needs]
- **Key Scenarios**: [Important user flows to test]
- **Performance Tests**: [Basic load testing if needed]

#### Python-Specific Testability Improvements
```python
# Before: Hard to test - tightly coupled
class OrderService:
 def process_order(self, order):
 # Direct database calls, external APIs
 result = Database.save(order)
 EmailService.send(order.customer_email)
 PaymentGateway.charge(order.total)
 return result

# After: Dependency injection with protocols
from typing import Protocol
from dataclasses import dataclass
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class DatabaseProtocol(Protocol):
 def save(self, order: Order) -> OrderResult: ...

class EmailServiceProtocol(Protocol):
 async def send(self, email: str) -> None: ...

class PaymentProtocol(Protocol):
 def charge(self, amount: float) -> PaymentResult: ...

@dataclass
class OrderService:
 database: DatabaseProtocol
 email_service: EmailServiceProtocol
 payment_service: PaymentProtocol

 async def process_order(self, order: Order) -> OrderResult:
 # Easy to test with mocks
 result = await self.database.save(order)
 await self.email_service.send(order.customer_email)
 payment_result = self.payment_service.charge(order.total)
 return OrderResult(result, payment_result)

# Test example
import pytest
from unittest.mock import Mock, AsyncMock

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_process_order():
 # Arrange
 mock_db = Mock()
 mock_email = AsyncMock()
 mock_payment = Mock()

 service = OrderService(mock_db, mock_email, mock_payment)
 order = Order(customer_email="test@example.com", total=100.0)

 # Act
 result = await service.process_order(order)

 # Assert
 mock_db.save.assert_called_once_with(order)
 mock_email.send.assert_called_once_with("test@example.com")
 mock_payment.charge.assert_called_once_with(100.0)
```

#### Python Testing Patterns
```python
# Use pytest fixtures for common test data
@pytest.fixture
def sample_user():
 return User(name="John Doe", email="john@example.com", age=30)

# Use parametrize for multiple test cases
@pytest.mark.parametrize("input_value,expected", [
 ("hello", "HELLO"),
 ("world", "WORLD"),
 ("", ""),
])
def test_uppercase(input_value, expected):
 assert uppercase(input_value) == expected

# Use context managers for testing exceptions
def test_invalid_email():
 with pytest.raises(ValidationError, match="Invalid email format"):
 validate_email("invalid-email")
```
