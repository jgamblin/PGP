## Common Async Patterns

### Making HTTP Requests
```python
# Good - using aiohttp
import aiohttp

async def fetch_data(url):
 async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
 async with session.get(url) as response:
 return await response.json()

# Avoid - blocking requests in async function
import requests # Don't do this in async code

async def bad_fetch(url):
 return requests.get(url).json() # Blocks the event loop!
```

### Running Multiple Tasks
```python
# Good - concurrent execution
import asyncio

async def process_urls(urls):
 tasks = [fetch_data(url) for url in urls]
 results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
 return results

# Less efficient - sequential
async def process_urls_slow(urls):
 results = []
 for url in urls:
 result = await fetch_data(url) # One at a time
 results.append(result)
 return results
```

### Proper Resource Cleanup
```python
# Good - ensures cleanup
async def read_file_async(filename):
 async with aiofiles.open(filename, 'r') as f:
 content = await f.read()
 return content # File automatically closed

# Risky - might leak resources
async def read_file_bad(filename):
 f = await aiofiles.open(filename, 'r')
 content = await f.read()
 await f.close() # What if an exception happens?
 return content
```




## Tooling & Automation

Recommended tools and commands for Python development:

### Analysis & Quality Tools
```bash
# Python code quality
ruff check .
black --check .
mypy .

# Testing
pytest --cov=. --cov-report=term-missing

# Security
bandit -r .
pip-audit
```

### Git Analysis
```bash
# Review changes
git diff main...HEAD --stat
git log --oneline -10

# Identify changed files
git diff main...HEAD --name-only
```

### CI/CD Integration
Recommend adding these to your development workflow:
```bash
# Pre-commit hooks
pre-commit run ruff --all-files
pre-commit run black --all-files
pre-commit run mypy --all-files
```

### Pre-commit Hooks (Recommended)
```bash
# Install pre-commit framework
pip install pre-commit  # or brew install pre-commit

# Set up hooks
pre-commit install
pre-commit run --all-files
```


## Metrics & Validation

Define clear success criteria for outcomes:

### Quality Gates
- **Security**: Zero critical vulnerabilities, zero hardcoded secrets
- **Code Quality**: Ruff and Black passes with minimal warnings
- **Complexity**: Cyclomatic complexity <10 per function/method
- **Duplication**: No code blocks duplicated more than twice
- **Documentation**: Public APIs and complex logic documented

### Testing Thresholds
- **Critical paths**: 80% test coverage
- **All tests pass**: No failing tests without corresponding code changes
- **Test quality**: Tests verify behavior, not implementation details
- **Edge cases**: Error conditions and boundary cases tested

### Performance Benchmarks (if applicable)
- **No regressions**: Performance metrics maintained or improved
- **Response times**: Within acceptable thresholds for user-facing operations
- **Resource usage**: Memory and CPU usage within reasonable bounds
- **Scalability**: System handles expected load

### Operational Readiness
- **Documentation**: README, API docs, and runbooks up-to-date
- **Monitoring**: Key metrics and errors are observable
- **Deployment**: Automated deployment process works reliably



## Follow-Up & Continuous Improvement

### Feedback Loop
After implementing changes:

1. **Verify improvements**
   - Run all tests to ensure nothing broke
   - Check that metrics improved (quality scores, performance)
   - Gather feedback from team members or users
   - Validate that issues are actually resolved

2. **Monitor impact**
   - Track if bugs decreased in modified areas
   - Measure if development velocity improved
   - Note if system reliability increased
   - Observe user satisfaction changes

3. **Document learnings**
   - Update team standards based on findings
   - Create architecture decision records (ADRs) for significant changes
   - Share successful patterns and approaches
   - Update documentation with new practices

### When to Get Team Input
When to discuss with your teammates:
- **Breaking changes needed**: Discuss with the team before making major changes
- **Performance degradation**: Roll back and investigate if metrics worsen significantly
- **Test coverage drops**: Pause changes to add tests first
- **Security concerns**: Pair with a teammate on authentication, authorization, or data handling code
- **Team confusion**: Provide additional documentation, pairing, or training

### Continuous Improvement
- Schedule regular reviews (weekly/monthly/quarterly based on project activity)
- Gradually increase quality standards as codebase improves
- Celebrate wins and improvements with the team
- Keep improvements incremental and sustainable
- Build a culture of quality and continuous learning

### Process Optimization
Based on findings, consider updating:
- **Coding standards**: Add patterns that prevent common issues
- **Review checklists**: Include checks for identified problem areas
- **CI/CD pipelines**: Add automated checks for recurring issues
- **Documentation templates**: Standardize important documentation
- **Team practices**: Share knowledge and establish better workflows
